metric-time
===========
Take a look at metric time through a Processing.js/ClojureScript analog and
digital metric clock. Divide the day into 100 periods; each is nearly 15
minutes apiece. Just about 4 to an hour. It's quite easy to transition from
imperial to metric time.

**It's time for metric time.**
